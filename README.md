# GoPlaces

For a visitor in new city/town itâ€™s hard to find places worth visit and explore the city by visiting the locations that are the centre of attraction.  
So here is the solution.. GoPlaces, an app which acts as guide for you by suggesting the places nearby that are worth a visit, also provides information about the place along with images for you to decide whether to visit it or not. Provides the functionality of rating and liking the place which will be helpful for other users.

## Getting Started

## Features of the app

Clicking on the marker denoting any place of interest opens a pop up window.  
Here at the top, you are shown a slideshow in images of the place.  
Below this, You get the star rating on the left and like button on the right.  
Next, you have a scrollable information about the place.

### Rating

The number of likes is updated for all users

### My Places/Visit Later
